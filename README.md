# saga-server

This server will serve as a basic tool for allowing users to `saga pull` and `saga push`, which will make it possible for them to collaborate across the internets.

## Directions

```
cd express-server;
npm install;
DEBUG=myapp:* npm start;
```

To see the front-end, browse to `localhost:3000`.
